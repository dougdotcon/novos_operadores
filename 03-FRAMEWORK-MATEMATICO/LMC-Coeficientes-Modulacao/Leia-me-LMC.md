README – Leue Modulation Coefficients (LMC)
This repository contains the standalone release of the Leue Modulation Coefficients (LMC), including:
• The full research paper describing the mathematical construction of the LMC continuum field.
• A Python implementation that reproduces the numerical example.
• A plot visualizing the discrete LMC values and their smooth embedding.
• Supporting documentation.
Contents:
1. Paper (PDF)
The main document explains:
- the definition of the LMC sequence,
- the construction of the smooth field,
- the conductivity model,
- stability properties,
- the numerical example.
2. Python Script
The script generates:
- the discrete LMC data,
- the smooth LMC field,
- the conductivity field,
- the numerical plot.
3. Plot
The included plot compares discrete values with the smooth continuum field.
Usage:
Run the Python script with any standard Python 3 environment containing numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
