Cover letter
This release provides the reference implementation and documentation for the
Leue Modulation Coefficients (LMC), a bounded arithmetic modulation derived
from the normalized local coefficients of an elliptic curve. The work develops a
smooth continuum embedding of the discrete sequence, constructs a uniformly
elliptic conductivity field, and establishes pointwise flux bounds via a Lyapunov-
type energy functional. An explicit numerical example shows how discrete arith-
metic structure is preserved under mollification. The project provides the full
research paper, supporting code, plots, and data.
