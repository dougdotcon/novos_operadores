THE THEORY OF RESONANCE: NUMERICAL VERIFICATION SUITE


============================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


OVERVIEW:


This document describes the numerical scripts provided to verify the core


theorems of "The Theory of Resonance". These scripts implement the


ontological Primary Code (P = {0, 1, +1}) and demonstrate its application


across number theory, topology, and quantum mechanics.


FILES AND THEIR FUNCTION:


1. 2-4-6 Gap Proof.py


- Verifies Chapter 10: Arithmetic Resonance Framework.


- Generates prime gap statistics and demonstrates the deterministic


2-4-6 cadence (mod 6 structure) of prime numbers.


- Provides the 3D "Prime Helix" visualization, showing that primes


stabilize at helical positions of 60° and 300°.


2. Topologische Raumkonstruktion S3.py


- Verifies Chapter 8: The 3-Sphere as Constructed Resonance Space.


- Computes the Betti numbers (beta_0=1, beta_1=0, beta_2=0, beta_3=1)


for the boundary of a 4-simplex.


- Mathematically proves that the +1 operator constructs the 3-sphere


(Poincaré certificate).


3. Quanten Collaps.py / doppler analysis.py


- Verifies Chapter 12: Observer-Modulator Framework.


- Implements the "Soft-Collapse" mechanism using the sigmoid resonance


activation function R(L).


- Demonstrates the sharp transition (k-parameter) where potential


collapses into reality.


4. Wassersroff-Spektrum.py


- Verifies Chapter 5.4: Energy Quantization.


- Computes the Lyman and Balmer series based on the Surplus Operator


transitions (|n> +1 -> |n+1>).


- Validates the theory against observed physical spectral lines.


TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:


- Python 3.11 or higher


- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, sympy, mpmath


REPRODUCIBILITY:


All scripts are designed to be self-contained. Random seeds are controlled


to ensure that the numerical outputs matches the values reported in the


main monograph.
